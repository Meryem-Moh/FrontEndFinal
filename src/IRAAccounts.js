      <h6>Regular/ Traditional IRA is is a type of individual retirement account that lets your earnings grow tax-deferred. You pay taxes on your investment gains only when you make withdrawals in retirement.</h6>
      <h6> Rollover IRA  is an account that allows you to move funds from your old employer-sponsored retirement plan into an IRA. With an IRA rollover, you can preserve the tax-deferred status of your retirement assets, without paying current taxes or early withdrawal penalties at the time of transfer.
      </h6>
      <h6>Roth IRA  is an individual retirement account that offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Roth IRA rules dictate that as long as you've owned your account for 5 years* and you're age 59Â½ or older, you can withdraw your money when you want to and you won't owe any federal taxes.</h6>
